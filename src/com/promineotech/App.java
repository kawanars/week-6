	//2. Create a class called App with a main method.

	//a.      Instantiate a Deck and two Players, call the shuffle method on the deck.
//	b.     Using a traditional for loop, iterate 52 times calling the Draw method on the other player each iteration using the Deck you instantiated.
	//c.      Using a traditional for loop, iterate 26 times and call the flip method for each player.
	//Compare the value of each card returned by the two player’s flip methods. Call the incrementScore method on the player whose card has the higher value.  Print a message to say which player received a point.
//	Note:  If the values are equal (it is a tie), print a message saying that no point was awarded.
//	d.      After the loop, compare the final score from each player.
//	e.      Print the final score of each player and either “Player 1”, “Player 2”, or “Draw” depending on which score is higher or if they are both the same.
